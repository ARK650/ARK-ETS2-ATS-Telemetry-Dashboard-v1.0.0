    ↳ Starts server + auto-opens browser + shows IP

[2] Start Server Only
    ↳ Console output for debugging

[3] Show Network IP
    ↳ Get URL for phone/tablet

[4] Stop Server
    ↳ Clean shutdown

[5] Exit
    ↳ Stop and close
```

## 🎨 WARNING LIGHTS: STATIC GLOW INSTEAD OF PULSATING

### Changed:
- ❌ **Before:** Pulsating animation (flash 0.6s infinite)
- ✅ **After:** Static bright glow (steady, professional)

### Details:
```css
/* Removed pulsating animation */
- animation: flash 0.6s infinite;

/* Enhanced static glow */
+ box-shadow: 
    0 0 30px [color] (outer glow),
    0 0 15px [color] (inner glow),
    0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.4) (shadow)
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ More professional look
- ✅ Less distracting
- ✅ Easier to see status at a glance

**Note:** Turn signals still blink (realistic for indicators!)
